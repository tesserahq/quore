## MCP Servers

I have a Python FastAPI API connected to a Postgres database. This API includes an “assistant” endpoint that interacts with tools (MCP servers). All AI-related functionality is built using LlamaIndex and AgentWorkflow. [Reference]
Users interact with the API through a web interface. Both the web interface and the API are hosted under the same domain and use Auth0 for authentication. I also have an MCP server that communicates with another API, which is secured using the same Auth0 system—so all these servers can trust the same token.
What I need to understand is how to pass the token that the UI uses (generated by Auth0) to access the assistant endpoint, down to the MCP server, so it can use that token to interact with the other API.
