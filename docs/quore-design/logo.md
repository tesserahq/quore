Logo Concept: Modular Intelligence

Design Elements:
* Q as a Core Element: Stylized “Q” incorporating a modular dot or square that hints at plugin architecture. The dot can sit inside or beside the “Q” ring, implying extensibility.
* Geometric Construction: Based on the Golden Ratio or precise grid alignments, ensuring visual harmony.
* Sans-serif Typeface: Clean, modern, and highly legible — conveying tech-savviness and reliability.
* Monochrome or Dual-tone Palette: Suggests professionalism and adaptability, perhaps with a slight futuristic hue (e.g., midnight blue and cyan).
* Vector node or plug-in iconography: Subtle cues referencing vector search and plugin architecture—like interlocking segments or nodes radiating from the “Q”.

Logo Usage:
* A symbol-only variant (just the Q) for favicon and app icons.
* A full logotype reading “Quore” for web and documents.
* Optional vertical stack or horizontal orientation.
