### Workspace images

A flat-style digital illustration of a minimalist and cozy home workspace. The scene features a pastel-colored environment with a clean white background. A wooden desk with soft pink metal legs holds a computer monitor displaying a simple blue logo (a stylized Q with a small square). On the desk are a pastel pink desk lamp, a white pencil holder with colorful pens, a cactus in a beige mug, and a wire waste basket below. A pastel pink chair sits neatly at the desk. Above, a floating shelf holds small plants and a few stacked books. A framed artwork on the wall also displays the same blue logo. The overall color palette is soft, with pastel tones and a clean, airy feel.



### Project images

A flat-style digital illustration showing a minimal and organized project environment within a workspace, focused on LLM configuration and active work. A large wall-mounted whiteboard is at the center, surrounded by two pastel gray servers. On the board, there is a flowchart using soft blue and orange pastel tones. It includes labeled boxes such as “BIG DATA”, “LANGUAGE MODEL”, “CONVERSATION”, “LIVE LOGS”, “API”, “API HANDLERS”. Arrows connect the concepts in a logical flow. Around the whiteboard are sticky notes, small documents, and abstract icons representing code snippets and plugin systems. A calm, clean design with a soft white background and pastel accents matching a professional but friendly AI development environment. Avoid using real framework names or logos.
