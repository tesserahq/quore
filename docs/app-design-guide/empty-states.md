## What Are Empty States?

Empty states occur when there’s no data or content to show in a particular section of an app or website. Common examples include:

- A new user’s inbox with no messages.
- A search that returns no results.
- A task list with no tasks added yet.

While these moments might seem insignificant, they’re actually critical touchpoints in the user journey.

## ⚙️ Why Empty States Matter

Empty states are important because they:

1. **Provide Guidance** – Help users understand what to do next.  
2. **Reduce Frustration** – Turn confusion into clarity.  
3. **Enhance Engagement** – Connect with users and add personality to your design.  
4. **Build Trust** – Clear communication shows that your product is thoughtful and reliable.

## Key Principles for Designing Empty States

### 1. Be Clear and Informative

Explain why the screen is empty and what the user can do about it.  
**Example**: “No tasks yet. Tap the ‘+’ button to create one.”

### 2. Add Visual Appeal

Use illustrations, icons, or animations to make the empty state visually engaging. Avoid leaving the screen completely blank.

### 3. Provide Actionable Steps

Guide users on what to do next. Include a button or link that takes them to the next logical step.

### 4. Inject Personality

Use tone and visuals to reflect your brand’s personality. A friendly message or a playful illustration can make the experience more enjoyable.

## Best Practices for Designing Empty States

### 1. Use Illustrations Thoughtfully

Illustrations can make empty states more engaging, but they should be relevant and meaningful.  
**Example**: A travel app might show an empty suitcase for a “No trips planned” state.

### 2. Write Helpful Copy

Keep your text concise and actionable. Avoid technical jargon and focus on helping the user.

### 3. Include a Call-to-Action (CTA)

Encourage users to take the next step.  
**Example**: “Start your first project” or “Explore recommended items.”

### 4. Test with Real Users

Empty states are often overlooked in testing, but they’re just as important as any other part of the interface. Ensure your empty states are clear and helpful by testing them with real users.

## Examples of Great Empty State Design

- **Slack** – When there are no messages in a channel, Slack shows a friendly illustration and a message like “This channel is quiet for now.”
- **Trello** – An empty board includes a prompt to “Add a card” and provides tips on how to use the board effectively.
- **Google Drive** – When a folder is empty, Google Drive suggests actions like “Upload files” or “Create new documents.”

## Collaboration is Key

Designing effective empty states requires collaboration between designers, copywriters, and developers. Designers create the visuals, copywriters craft the messaging, and developers ensure the empty states are implemented correctly.

## Conclusion: Turn Blank Spaces into Opportunities ✔

Empty states are more than just placeholders — they’re opportunities to guide, engage, and delight users. By designing thoughtful and intentional empty states, you can turn potential frustration into a positive experience.

Remember, every screen in your app or website tells a story, even the empty ones. So, the next time you’re working on a design, don’t overlook the art of the empty state.

Let’s design empty states that inspire and empower users.
