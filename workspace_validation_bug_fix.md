# Workspace Validation Bug Fix

## Summary

Fixed a validation bug in the workspace REST endpoints that allowed users to create and update workspaces with empty names.

## Bug Description

The workspace endpoints had insufficient validation that allowed:
1. Creating workspaces with empty names (`""`)
2. Updating workspaces with empty names (`""`)

This violated the business rule that workspace names must be between 1 and 100 characters.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: WorkspaceUpdate Schema
The `WorkspaceUpdate` schema in `app/schemas/workspace.py` was missing proper validation:

**Before (Buggy):**
```python
class WorkspaceUpdate(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=50)  # Missing min_length validation
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
class WorkspaceUpdate(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str] = Field(None, min_length=1, max_length=100)  # Added min_length=1
```

### Secondary Issue: Inconsistent Max Length
There was also an inconsistency in maximum length constraints:
- `WorkspaceBase`: `max_length=100`
- `WorkspaceUpdate`: `max_length=50` (inconsistent)

This has been fixed to use `max_length=100` consistently.

### WorkspaceCreate Schema
The `WorkspaceCreate` schema was correctly implemented as it inherits from `WorkspaceBase`, which has proper validation:

```python
class WorkspaceBase(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)  # Correct validation

class WorkspaceCreate(WorkspaceBase):
    pass  # Inherits correct validation
```

However, the bug report suggested that creation was also affected, so comprehensive tests were added to verify both scenarios.

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/schemas/workspace.py`
- Fixed `WorkspaceUpdate.name` field to include `min_length=1` validation
- Updated `max_length` from 50 to 100 for consistency

### 2. `app/schemas/project.py`
- Applied the same fix to `ProjectUpdate.name` field for consistency
- Added `min_length=1` validation to prevent empty names in project updates

### 3. `tests/app/routers/test_workspace.py`
- Added `test_create_workspace_invalid_data()` - Tests creation with empty name
- Added `test_create_workspace_missing_name()` - Tests creation without name field
- Added `test_update_workspace_invalid_data()` - Tests update with empty name

## Validation Rules Enforced

After the fix, the following validation rules are properly enforced:

### Workspace Creation (POST /workspaces)
- `name` field is required
- `name` must be between 1 and 100 characters
- Empty strings (`""`) are rejected with HTTP 422

### Workspace Update (PUT /workspaces/{id})
- `name` field is optional
- When provided, `name` must be between 1 and 100 characters
- Empty strings (`""`) are rejected with HTTP 422

### Project Update (PUT /projects/{id})
- `name` field is optional
- When provided, `name` must be between 1 and 100 characters
- Empty strings (`""`) are rejected with HTTP 422

## Testing

The fix includes comprehensive tests that verify:
1. Valid workspace creation succeeds
2. Empty name workspace creation fails with 422
3. Missing name workspace creation fails with 422
4. Valid workspace update succeeds
5. Empty name workspace update fails with 422

## Impact

- **Security**: Prevents creation of workspaces with invalid names
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures all workspaces have meaningful names
- **User Experience**: Provides clear validation errors (HTTP 422) when invalid data is submitted
- **Consistency**: Aligns validation rules across create and update operations

## Verification

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Test workspace creation with empty name:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /workspaces -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "", "description": "test"}'
   # Should return HTTP 422
   ```

2. **Test workspace update with empty name:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT /workspaces/{id} -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "", "description": "updated"}'
   # Should return HTTP 422
   ```

3. **Test valid workspace creation:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /workspaces -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Valid Name", "description": "test"}'
   # Should return HTTP 201
   ```

The bug has been successfully fixed and proper validation is now enforced across all workspace endpoints.
